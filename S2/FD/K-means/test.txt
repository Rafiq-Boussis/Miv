X1 = [0, 3]
X2 = [0, 0]

M1 = [2, 1]
M2 = [3.5, 1]

D(X1, M1) = [|0-2| + |3 -1|] = 4
D(X1, M2) = [|0-3.5| + |3 -1|] = 5.5
D(X2, M1) = [|0-2| + |0-1|] = 3

D(C1)

- if the distance enternal is small than the previous one (distance(Ck))
then the new clustering is giving a better result.

- if the distance external is bigger than the previous one (distance(Ck, Ck+1))
then the new clustering is giving better then the one before

""iterative clustering"" work on iterative

idea. think about minimal distance on how to performe minimal clustering
